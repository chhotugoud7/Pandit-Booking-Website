### 1. Project Description

**Pandit Booking Website** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The website enables users to view detailed profiles of pandits, check their availability, and make bookings for various religious services. The platform also offers an **Admin Dashboard** for managing users, bookings, and payments.

The application integrates **Razorpay** for secure payment processing, allowing users to make hassle-free payments for their bookings. Designed with **Tailwind CSS**, the website ensures a responsive and modern user interface, providing a seamless experience across devices.

Key features of the platform include user registration, profile management, real-time booking system, and secure payment integration. This project aims to simplify the process of booking pandits for religious ceremonies and rituals.




### 2. Technologies Used

- **MERN Stack**:
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, making it easy to scale and manage dynamic data. MongoDB is used in the backend to store user profiles, booking information, and other relevant data.
  - **Express.js**: A minimalistic web framework for Node.js, Express is used for building the backend of the application, handling HTTP requests, and managing routing and middleware.
  - **React.js**: A JavaScript library used for building dynamic, interactive user interfaces in a single-page application format. React allows for component-based architecture, making it easier to manage complex UI states and interactions in the frontend.
  - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling you to build fast and scalable network applications. Node.js powers the backend and handles business logic, data processing, and API routes.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that accelerates web development by offering a wide range of pre-configured utility classes. Tailwind allows you to design custom, responsive layouts directly in your HTML, reducing the need for writing custom CSS and ensuring a more streamlined development process.

- **Razorpay**: A secure payment gateway integrated into the booking process to handle payments. Razorpay allows users to pay for their puja bookings with ease using methods like debit/credit cards, wallets, and UPI, ensuring a seamless and trustworthy transaction experience.

- **ESLint & Prettier**: These tools are used to ensure consistent code style across the project. ESLint helps in identifying and fixing JavaScript errors, while Prettier automatically formats code to maintain a clean and readable style, improving the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.

- **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool that serves as the development server for the React frontend. Vite offers fast hot module replacement (HMR) and builds optimizations, providing a smooth development experience.

- **Cloudinary**: A cloud service for managing images and other media assets. It is used for optimizing and serving images dynamically, ensuring faster load times and better image management for the site.

This stack of technologies powers both the frontend and backend of the Pandit Booking Website, providing a smooth user experience and efficient backend operations.
